# movie-search-site-
A simple web app that allows users to search for movies by title and view movie posters, release years, and IMDb ratings. Users can add movies to their favorites list, which is saved locally, and remove them as needed. The app uses the OMDb API for fetching movie data and leverages localStorage for saving favorite movies.
